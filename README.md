# Skin_Cancer_detection_using_CNN
In this project, the aim is to classify dermoscopic images into two classes: "Malignant" and "Benign". Two approaches were employeed 
to achieve this goal. In the first approach, a set of features and descriptors is being calculated for each segmented binary image, 
including border pixel count, non-zero pixel count, circularity, degree of asymmetry, and color histogram. These features are used to train a 
classifier to categorize images into the two classes.
In the second approach, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) is being utilized to classify dermoscopic images. 
The CNN is trained on a set of images and evaluated on a different set of images.
